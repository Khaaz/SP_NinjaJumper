# NinjaJumper [SP]

+ **Category**: School Project
+ **Status**: Discontinued

## **Overview**

This project is a Ninja Jumper mobile app written in Java android. This was a school project in team of 2.  
This is basically a copy of [Doodle Jump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doodle_Jump).

## **Goal / Requirements**

We had to create a mobile game in android.  
One of the requirements was to use one of the mobile native functionality. In our cases we used the accelerometer.

We had to create a well-written and designed application with all OOP principles.  
This was an introduction to android natives apps and was directly following [Interstella project](https://github.com/Khaazz/SP_Interstella).

We took particular care about writing a well written application.  
The project is mostly in a working state but behave differently when ran on development and when published on the play-store. It would need few adjustements to make it fully functional. It could also benefits more features, but the application is working correctly however.

## **Technologies**

+ Java 7
+ Android
+ Android Studio
+ Threads (via java Thread Pools)

We tried to follow Object Oriented Programming principles such as:

+ SOLID
  + Single-responsibility Principle
  + Open-closed Principle
  + Liskov Substitution Principle
  + Interface Segregation Principle
  + Dependency Inversion Principle
+ Separation of Concerns  
...

We also tried to implement some of OOP design patterns (factory, strategy, observer, chain of responsability...)
